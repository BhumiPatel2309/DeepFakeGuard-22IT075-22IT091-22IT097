DeepfakeGuard is a deep learning-based web application designed to detect deepfakes in both images and videos. This project uses powerful Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, particularly EfficientNet variants, to identify manipulated or synthetic media. It aims to provide a reliable solution to combat the growing threat of deepfake content by classifying media as real or fake with high accuracy. The dataset used consists of publicly available deepfake datasets such as FaceForensics++ and the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) dataset.
